### Guidelines for Next.js

- Use App Router for new features and pages
- Leverage Server Actions for form handling and mutations
- Use API Routes in `/pages/api` for external API endpoints
- Use POST, GET - uppercase format for API route handlers
- Use zod for input validation in API routes and Server Actions
- Extract logic into services in `src/lib/services`
- Implement middleware in `middleware.ts` for request/response modification
- Use Next.js Image component for automatic image optimization
- Leverage Server Components by default, use Client Components when needed
- Use cookies() from 'next/headers' for server-side cookie management
- Use process.env for environment variables
